# A1-NLP-st125054
GitHub repo for Assignment A1 of NLP 2025


For this project, I completed the following tasks:

1. Modify the Word2Vec (with & without negative sampling) and GloVe from the lab lecture (3 points)
• Train using a real-world corpus (used 'webtext' corpus from MLTK dataset.)
• Create a function that allows dynamic modification of the window size during training. Use a window size of 2 as default.

2. Compare Skip-gram, Skip-gram negative sampling, GloVe models on training loss, training time.

3. Use Word analogies dataset 3 to calucalte between syntactic and semantic accuracy, similar to the methods in the Word2Vec and GloVe paper.

4. Develop a simple website with an input box for search queries. The engine returns top 10 most similar words to the query from our corpus.
